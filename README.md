# Blood_Volume
This is a code with simple interface that will estimate blood volume in your body using different methods!

There are a few methods that will allow you to get these values:
 - Nadler method - it requires inputting sex, height and weight
 - Gilcher method - it requires inputting sex, type of body and weight
 - TBV method (Total Blood Volume) - it requires inputting sex and weight
If you choose Nadler method, you can also estimate mass of hemoglobine. 

It requires putting hemoglobine or number of erythrocytes and MCH, which you can read from your Red Blood Cell Morphology results.
